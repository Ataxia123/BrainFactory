- The purpose of this vault is to generate proof of knowledge enabled dapps. The process of converting is as follows:

-> Create ontology for the generation of new systems. Utilize [[baseOntology]] to generate a new system for the task at hand.
->  Modify the [[baseClass]] so that it matches [[baseOntology]]. Refactor the prompts as required.
-> Refactor the [[chatRoute]] 

---


 to integrate the new ontology and base class. Update the functions and logic to align with the new system requirements.
-> Test the new system thoroughly to ensure proper functionality and compatibility with the proof of knowledge enabled dapps.
-> Deploy the updated system and monitor for any issues or errors that may arise.
-> Provide documentation and support for developers utilizing the proof of knowledge enabled dapps generated from this vault.

Overall, the goal is to streamline the process of creating and implementing proof of knowledge enabled dapps by leveraging the capabilities of this vault and ensuring a smooth transition from concept to deployment.
